In this project, I took a desktop-heavy AI dashboard and re-engineered it for a mobile-first merchant experience. By optimizing the data fetching layer between our React frontend and FastAPI backend, we boosted dashboard performance by 30%.

This allowed merchants to make real-time decisions without the friction of high-latency data loading.
