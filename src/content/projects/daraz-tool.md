I developed this desktop automation tool to solve a specific logistics bottleneck. It handles the end-to-end transformation of fragmented data into print-optimized layouts.

**Key Technical Contributions:**

- **Full-Stack Ownership:** Architected the entire solution from the React interface to the Electron.js runtime environment.
- **Custom Processing Engine:** Developed a specialized engine that reads multiple PDF sources and re-aligns them into optimized layouts to minimize material waste.
- **Product-Minded Automation:** Transformed a multi-step manual chore into a simple two-click automation (Upload, Adjust, Download), demonstrating a focus on operational ROI.
