I was commissioned to architect a transparent tracking system for a welfare society. I handled the entire development cycle, from the database architecture to the final user interface.

**Key Technical Contributions:**

- **Hierarchical Data Orchestration:** Architected a normalized Firebase schema to synchronize the relationships between Streets, Houses, and individual Fund Collections.
- **Financial Intelligence:** Developed custom aggregation logic to provide stakeholders with instant snapshots of collections and expenses across daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes.
- **End-to-End Delivery:** Managed the full-stack lifecycle, including database design, secure cloud authentication, and a high-contrast administrative interface.
- **Ledger Management:** Engineered a worker ledger system to track salaries and pending disbursements, ensuring total financial accountability for the community.
