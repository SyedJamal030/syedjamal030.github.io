## The Technical Challenge
The core of Product Genius AI is a sophisticated "Observer" widget. As a **Senior Frontend Engineer**, my mission was to maintain and upgrade the Merchant Dashboard, which serves as the brain for store owners to manage subscriptions, content integrations, and widget customization.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Extending Shopify Polaris
To maintain a "Pixel-Perfect" standard without duplicating code, I architected a custom component library on top of **Shopify Polaris**. By using TypeScript generics and CSS variables, I created reusable wrappers (like the `PGButton`) that allowed us to customize the design system efficiently while staying within the Polaris ecosystem.

### 2. The Design Tab Evolution
I led the overhaul of the **Design Tab**, a complex in-app editor. I transformed it into a fully responsive interface, ensuring merchants could manage their AI widget layouts and product cards seamlessly from any device, including mobile.

### 3. Performance-First Public Site
I developed the new version of the public-facing marketing site using **Next.js (SSG)** and **TailwindCSS**. By leveraging Static Site Generation, I ensured the site achieved top-tier Core Web Vitals and SEO performance.

### 4. Codebase Refactoring
I took ownership of a codebase that had passed through multiple hands. I implemented a clean folder structure and modular architecture, which significantly reduced file clutter and increased the team's development velocity.
