Product Genius AI brings a TikTok style scrolling experience to Shopify. I led the frontend maintenance and UI evolution, focusing on transforming complex AI training data into accessible merchant dashboards.

**Key Technical Contributions:**
* **Mobile-First Architecture:** Navigated the complexity of data-heavy dashboards to implement a fully responsive mobile version, significantly improving merchant accessibility.
* **API Integration:** Bridged the frontend with a FastAPI backend to visualize real-time analytics like content views and click-through rates.
* **Design Synchronization:** Collaborated closely with the design team to ensure a premium, conversion-driven user experience using Shopify’s Polaris system.
