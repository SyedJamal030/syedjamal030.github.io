Product Genius AI leverages a TikTok style scrolling experience for Shopify. I led the frontend architecture and UI evolution, focusing on the visualization of massive AI training datasets for merchant end-users.

**Key Technical Contributions:**

- **UX Engineering:** Successfully navigated the technical hurdles of rendering data-heavy dashboards on small screens, delivering a fully responsive mobile version.
- **Real-Time Data Visualization:** Engineered the integration between the React frontend and FastAPI backend to provide live analytics for content engagement and conversion metrics.
- **Design System Stewardship:** Collaborated with design teams to ensure a premium merchant experience while adhering to Shopify’s Polaris design constraints.
