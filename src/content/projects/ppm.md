PPM is an enterprise-grade real estate engine. I architected the core frontend foundation, ensuring the system could handle diverse business modules within a high-security environment.

**Key Technical Contributions:**

- **Scalable UI Architecture:** Designed a modular, component-based system capable of managing high-scale operations (Accounting, Leasing, and Maintenance) within a single SPA.
- **Technical Governance:** Supervised the frontend development lifecycle, performed rigorous code reviews, and managed cross-functional coordination via Jira.
- **Complex State Orchestration:** Integrated a strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage multi-tenant permissions and sensitive financial data.
