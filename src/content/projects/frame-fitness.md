Frame Fitness is a premium Pilates hardware brand. I was brought in to architect the initial storefront, focusing on a friction-less user journey and high-performance checkout flows.

**Key Technical Contributions:**

- **Pixel-Perfect Implementation:** Translated high-fidelity Figma specifications into a responsive, accessible interface that maintained strict brand integrity.
- **Backend Integration:** Managed complex GraphQL API integrations for dynamic content and bridged the frontend checkout flow with the Stripe payment architecture.
- **Performance Engineering:** Built a highly performant codebase designed to scale under the significant traffic spikes of a global product launch.
