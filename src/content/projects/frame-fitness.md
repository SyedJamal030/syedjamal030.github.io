## The Technical Challenge
Frame Fitness is a luxury brand selling a high-end Pilates Reformer. The digital requirement was a high-conversion platform that felt as premium as the hardware itself. My challenge was to build a rock-solid frontend architecture that could handle secure payments and dynamic content while maintaining 100% brand integrity.

## Key Contributions

### 1. High-Fidelity UI Development
Working directly from complex Figma specifications, I translated the luxury aesthetic into a pixel-perfect, responsive interface. This was a "Frontend-Only" ownership role where I ensured every transition, layout, and typography choice reflected the premium nature of the brand.

### 2. Hybrid Data Architecture (GraphQL & REST)
To power the dynamic blog system, I implemented **GraphQL** to fetch data directly from Shopify, while utilizing **RESTful APIs** for core product data. This hybrid approach allowed us to keep the frontend lightweight while leveraging the best features of different backend services.

### 3. Secure Payment Integration
I was responsible for integrating **Stripe** into the custom checkout flow. This required a deep understanding of asynchronous state management to ensure a seamless and secure transaction experience for high-ticket customers.

### 4. Cross-Functional Collaboration
I managed the entire frontend lifecycle, collaborating closely with a Django backend engineer. Together, we established the contract between the UI and the API, ensuring a smooth handoff and robust data validation across the platform.
