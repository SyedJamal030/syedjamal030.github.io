### The Challenge

As my independent practice grew, managing international developers, QA engineers, and designers via Google Sheets became a significant bottleneck. Fragmented work histories and manual hour tracking led to administrative bloat and potential for human error in financial distributions.

### The Solution

I engineered a centralized "Source of Truth" to handle the full lifecycle of team management. By building a custom suite, I moved beyond simple tracking into automated financial logic.

### Technical Implementation

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implemented a secure permission layer to ensure sensitive financial data and admin routes are only accessible to authorized users.
- **Automated Payroll Engine:** Developed logic to calculate monthly and custom-range payslips, accounting for fixed rates, hourly bonuses, and deductions.
- **Real-time Infrastructure:** Leveraged **Firebase** for instant data synchronization across the team dashboard and secure user authentication.
- **Fluid UI/UX:** Used **TailwindCSS** to build a responsive, dashboard-first interface that simplifies complex data entry for team members.

### Impact

The transition from manual sheets to this automated suite resulted in a **90% reduction in administrative time**, allowing me to focus more on high-level architecture and less on manual data entry.
