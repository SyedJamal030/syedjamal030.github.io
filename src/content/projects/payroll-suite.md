I engineered this suite to streamline my own business operations. It centralizes employee records and automates the complex logic required for variable payroll cycles.

**Key Technical Contributions:**

- **Serverless Architecture:** Managed the full-stack lifecycle, including Firebase NoSQL schema design, secure authentication, and a TypeScript-based frontend.
- **Financial Logic Engine:** Developed an automated engine to handle variable entries (bonuses, deductions, and time-range payouts) with 100% mathematical accuracy.
- **Administrative Optimization:** Engineered a one-click payroll slip generation and reporting system, eliminating the need for manual Google Sheet tracking.
